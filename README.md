This is a sketchpad project

The idea of the project is to create a grid with squares on a webpage
When the user's mouse passes over a square, the square turns black
There will also be an option to clear the board and an option to
change the number of squares in the grid

This project is part of The Odin Project to demonstrate JavaScript
and jQuery skills on top of HTML and CSS
